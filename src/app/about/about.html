    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Joshua. I'm a Computer Science major with a double concentration in Software
      Security and Data Science. I love blending curiosity with craft to understand how things work
      and how to make them more secure.

    <h2>What I like to do</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy tackling puzzles of all kinds&mdash;Rubik's cubes, chess, sudokus, or tough software
      problems. Solving them is a chance to practice patience, creativity, and stronger systems
      thinking.
